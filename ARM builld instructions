																Raspberry Pi, installtion instructions

note
tested on RPI 3 Model B and Raspbian Lite


Parts list
	⦁	Any RPI with 512MB of memory
	⦁	SD card 32GB or larger
	⦁	12v/ 2.5 Amp micro usb powersupply
	⦁	Raspbian or other Debian based flavor

I'm going to assume you've flashed your SD or micro SD card, with raspbian.  If you need help, check out, https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md, it has instuctions for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

prerequisites:
	sudo raspi-config
		⦁	Change locale settings if needed the default is en-GB	
		⦁	tasks enable ssh
		⦁	modify memory split to 16MB for video
		⦁	once those tasks are done exit the raspi-config window by pressing ESC on keyboard

	1.	sudo apt update
	2.	sudo apt upgrade
	3.	sudo reboot now

	4.	sudo apt install screen git ufw -y
	5.	sudo reboot now

Install Docker

	This will take six easy steps.
	This will download a script to install Docker for us and is based on the OS and hardware platform that you are using.

	A.	curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh
	B.	sudo groupadd docker, this should get done in the install but Ilike to make sure
	C.	sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker, this will add your current user to the docker group, if you have other users you wish to replace 		$USER with the account name you wish to add.
	D.	newgrp docker, otherwise your logging out and back in or doing a reboot.
	E.	Now on to the verification step, docker run hello-world, this will give you a greeting for docker
	F.	sudo reboot now

Install Go (golang)
	
	1.	Download go version 1.10.3, wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.10.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
	2.	Install Go, tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.10.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz
	3.	Modify the Path, export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
	4.	Add this line to the end of the .profile file,  PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
	5.	Check go install and configuration with go version, output should read, "go version go1.10.3 linux/arm."
	6.	sudo reboot now

Get the Nilu Platform form github and compile for arm
	
	A.	git clone https://github.com/NiluPlatform/go-nilu.git
	B.	cd go-nilu
	C.	make gilu
	D.	Once complete we can remove all the files that we downloaded from the git repo, but first we need to move the program we just compiled, type, mv ~/go-nilu/build/bin/gilu ~/
	E.	go-nilu>$ sudo rm -r *
	F.	mv ~/gilu ~/go-nilu/
	G.	test gilu now using ./gilu console --syncmode=light
